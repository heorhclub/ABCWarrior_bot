# ABCWarrior_bot
This is **ABCWarrior_bot** — your merciless personal Telegram bodyguard.\
It’s not particularly smart, but it is absolutely loyal and knows no mercy.

It stands guard over your channel with comments or your closed group — and operates exactly as a cold machine without emotions or doubts should:

- Silently deletes all voice messages
- Ruthlessly cuts any flooding
- Automatically mutes violators — quickly, without warnings, without the right to appeal, and proportionate to the violation

It doesn’t fall for pleas or tears.\
It doesn’t sleep. It doesn’t get tired. It doesn’t get distracted. It doesn’t forgive.\
While you live your real life and your friends and acquaintances chat —\
ABCWarrior_bot silently and brutally cleans the territory.

This is your comfort zone.\
Your rules.\
Your pride.\
Your tribe.

And this is its watch.\
Its war.\
**WARRRR.**
